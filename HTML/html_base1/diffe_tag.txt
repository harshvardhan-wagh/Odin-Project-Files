Here's a concise explanation of when to use each tag:

- **`<strong>` vs. `<b>`**:
  - **`<strong>`**: Use this when you want to indicate that text is of strong importance or has serious emphasis. It adds semantic meaning, which helps with accessibility (e.g., screen readers) and SEO.
  - **`<b>`**: Use this for stylistic bold text when no additional meaning is intended. It’s purely visual and doesn’t imply importance.

- **`<em>` vs. `<i>`**:
  - **`<em>`**: Use this when you want to stress or emphasize text semantically. It indicates that the text should be emphasized, which can affect how screen readers interpret the content.
  - **`<i>`**: Use this for text that is set off in an alternate voice or mood (like technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts) purely for visual styling, without implying emphasis.

In short, prefer `<strong>` and `<em>` when the meaning of your content matters, and use `<b>` and `<i>` when you only need to style text without adding extra semantic significance.
